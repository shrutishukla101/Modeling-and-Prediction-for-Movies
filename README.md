# Modeling-and-Prediction-for-Movies
The project aimed at predicting the IMDB rating of a sample data of movies taken from Duke University database. The dataset contained information from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. A prediction model was built using R with an accuracy of 96%. 
The prediction model helps to answer the following questionnaire:
  •	Is an Oscar winning actor or actress in the cast associated with the IMDB rating of the movie?
  •	Is there a difference in mean audience scores between genres?
  •	Which variables are associated with, and hence can be used to predict, the rating of a movie on IMDB?
